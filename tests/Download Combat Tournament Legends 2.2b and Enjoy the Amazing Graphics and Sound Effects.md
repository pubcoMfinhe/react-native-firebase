## Tips and Tricks for Playing Combat Tournament Legends 2.2b
 
Combat Tournament Legends 2.2b is not a game for the faint-hearted. You need to master the controls, learn the combos, and use your special attacks wisely. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you improve your skills and win more fights:

- Use the W or UP ARROW key to use your character's ability. Each character has a different ability that can give you an edge in combat. For example, Mr. Slaptastic can use his slaps to stun enemies, Yoyo can use his yoyo to grab enemies from a distance, and Stick Brian can use his guitar to unleash a sonic blast.
- Use the SPACE BAR or CTRL (right) key to jump and dodge attacks. You can also double-jump by pressing the key twice. Jumping can help you avoid getting hit by projectiles or low attacks, and also allow you to perform aerial combos.
- Use the G, H, J or ;, ', \ keys to attack. You can combine different keys to perform different combos. For example, pressing G twice and then H will make your character do a punch-punch-kick combo. Experiment with different combinations and find out what works best for you.
- Use the SPECIAL bar to unleash your power attack. The SPECIAL bar fills up as you deal or receive damage. When it is full, you can press G and H or ; and ' keys together to activate your power attack. Each character has a different power attack that can deal massive damage or affect multiple enemies. For example, Mr. Red can use his fire breath, Mr. Blue can use his ice blast, and Mr. Green can use his poison gas.
- Complete your missions to unlock new characters and new missions. You can access your missions by clicking on the "MISSIONS" button on the main menu. Each mission has a different objective and difficulty level. Completing missions will reward you with coins that you can use to buy new characters or upgrade your existing ones.

Combat Tournament Legends 2.2b is a game that requires skill, strategy, and practice. By following these tips and tricks, you can become a better fighter and enjoy the game more.
